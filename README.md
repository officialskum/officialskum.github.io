### Hyper Pong info: 

A group project me and a couple of friends from school worked on (Hampus Brandtman & Luca Salmi). We designed a working physics engine from the ground up inside Kotlin, custom graphic assets (kudos to Hampus) and we even made our own theme song for the game! The idea was to create a pong game with an RPG element where you could earn gems through playing which you could then spend in a gemshop for different perks (such as increase board-width, different powerups etc...)

### Trivia Quiz info: 

A colorful trivia app that I worked on together with a couple of classmates for our Swift course. It's a lightweight trivia app that uses the triviadb API to fetch and display questions with answers. We also implemented coredata to save and display highscore as well as functionality to revisit an old Quiz to see 
what you got right / wrong during your playthrough!

A lightweight (and slightly bland) notepad app I've made for my Java course at KYH! The UI so far is quite basic but it has all the necessary functionality 
with a save/load function as well as a delete function to boot. Something I'm looking to work further on a rainy day. ðŸ˜Ž

A vibrant and colorful weather application made with SwiftUI! Has a simple colorscheme with a toggle button for day/night mode!
