### **Starmony**  

During my time as an intern at Starmony, I had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects, including developing a new animated masking splash screen, an animated mixing screen, and a brand new artwork generator. I also gained a ton of experience working with the Combine framework and Async/await. Despite the challenges of working on an app used by thousands of users, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and learned a ton of cool new things and got to meet some awesome new people! 👨‍💻

### **Hyper Pong**  

A group project me and a couple of friends from school worked on (Hampus Brandtman & Luca Salmi). We designed a working physics engine from the ground up inside Kotlin, custom graphic assets (kudos to Hampus). I even took the time to create our own theme song with some input from the group! The idea was to create a pong game with an RPG element where you could earn gems through playing which you could then spend in a gemshop for different perks (such as increase board-width, different powerups etc...)

### **M.A.D. Tower Defense**  

Another group project I've been working on with my good friends Hampus Brandtman, Luca Salmi, Daniel Svensson and Calle Höglund from school! We've made a full-scale tower defense game through SpriteKit and SwiftUI with working upgrades, a really cool grid-building system for our foundation tiles that act as a barricade for the enemies as well as bosses! We've also got working pathfinding which I'm very proud of and as always Hampus really outdid himself with the assets. 🚀

### **Trivia Quiz** 

A colorful trivia app that I worked on together with a couple of classmates for our Swift course. It's a lightweight trivia app that uses the triviadb API to fetch and display questions with answers. We also implemented coredata to save and display highscore as well as functionality to revisit an old Quiz to see 
what you got right / wrong during your playthrough!

### **NotePad v2.0**

A lightweight (and slightly bland) notepad app I've made for my Java course at KYH! The UI so far is quite basic but it has all the necessary functionality 
with a save/load function as well as a delete function to boot. Something I'm looking to work further on a rainy day. 😎

### **SwiftUI WeatherApp**

A vibrant and colorful weather application made with SwiftUI. Has a simple gradient colorscheme with a toggle button for day/night mode. Will have to work 
further on it to implement a proper API so it can finally be put to use! ☔

## [Messenger App for iOS] (ONGOING)

### **Messenger iOS App**

Currently working on an app for iOS that aims to recreate common chat apps such as messenger, instagram, whatsapp and the like! Through firebase I've got a working backend and working on implementing a login authentication through Facebook, google and gmail (hopefully twitter as well but it's quite the process to get verified developer accounts through them 😅). Will update with pictures as soon as I've gotten the UI where I want it!
